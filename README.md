# HallSensor
Interfacing Hall sensor with Arduino : count the number of passage of a magnet in front of hall sensor

 There are actually, two different types of Hall sensors one is Digital Hall sensor and the other is Analog Hall sensor. 
 The digital Hall sensor can only detect if a magnet is present or not (0 or 1) but an analog hall sensorâ€™s output varies 
 based on the magnetic field around the magnet that is it can detect how strong or how far the magnet is. 
 In this project will aim only at the digital Hall sensors for they are the most commonly used ones.

Example of application :
Install the sensor on  door frame. attach a small magnet to the door. 
Thus, whenever the door closes,we can detect it and count the number of time it has been opened.
